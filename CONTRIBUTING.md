# Contributions

Since the column API is quite simple, it's easy to get started. Contributions are more than welcome. :)
You have an idea for a new column or want to improve an existing column?

The fastest way to get this done, is to fork the GitHub project, take a look at the existing code, copy and/or modify a column and create a pull-request.
